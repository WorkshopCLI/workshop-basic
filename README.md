# Workshop Basic (WorkshopCLI)

## Install Without WorkshopCLI

This is not recommended. It is recommended that you use [WorkshopCLI](https://github.com/WorkshopCLI/workshop-cli) to generate themes.

If you'd rather not use the CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/WorkshopCLI/workshop-basic.git && mv ./workshop-basic/theme ./workshop-basic-theme && rm -rf workshop-basic && cd workshop-basic-theme && yarn install
```
